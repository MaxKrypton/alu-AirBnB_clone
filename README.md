## Project Description

This is the first part of the AirBnB clone, whereby our group worked on the project's backend using Python language and cmd module to make our project interactive with the user.
Our project has a storage. We integrated file storage in our application with the help of JSON.

### Description of the command interpreter:

The application's command line interface is like a bash shell whereby a user inputs specific commands expecting a particular output. However, our application command interpreter accepts limited commands crafted to execute various purposes related to the Airbnb website. Overall, our command line interpreter acts as a frontend whereby users can interact with the backend using Python.
